A coding story
We use HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) to structure our web documents.
Some JavaScript
<p>This is a paragraph</p>
var para = document.querySelector('p');
para.onclick = function() {
  alert('Owww, stop poking me!');
}
In the above JavaScript example, para represents a variable that holds a paragraph element.
A little tip
Select all the text with Ctrl/Cmd + A.
